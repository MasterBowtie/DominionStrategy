# Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Specification

This tool is to take the Dominion Card Game and make a supply (10 cards) of kingdoms cards for the user to play with.
It should walk the user through step at a time.

    *   By Name
    *   Or any mix of the above

*   Starting over and playing again


## Phase 1: System Analysis 

**TODO**

*   List the things you know
*   List the things you have
*   List the Algorithms

## Phase 2: Design 

**Write the pseudocode for all the classes and methods inside them**

## Phase 3: Implementation

**Write what you learned, any troubles you had, any interesting things that happened**

## Phase 4: Testing & Debugging 

**Give Examples of good and bad inputs**
